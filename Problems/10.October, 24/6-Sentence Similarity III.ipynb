    "You are given two strings `sentence1` and `sentence2`, each representing a **sentence** composed of words. A sentence is a list of **words** that are separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of only uppercase and lowercase English characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two sentences `s1` and `s2` are considered **similar** if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence *(possibly empty)* inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. Note that the inserted sentence must be separated from existing words by spaces.\n",

    "For example,\n",
    "- `s1 = \"Hello Jane\"` and `s2 = \"Hello my name is Jane\"` can be made equal by inserting `\"my name is\"` between `\"Hello\"` and `\"Jane\"` in s1.\n",
    "- `s1 = \"Frog cool\"` and `s2 = \"Frogs are cool\"` are **not** similar, since although there is a sentence `\"s are\"` inserted into `s1`, it is not separated from `\"Frog\"` by a space.\n",
