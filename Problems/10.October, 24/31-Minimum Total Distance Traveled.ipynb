    "There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer array `robot` where `robot[i]` is the position of the **i<sup>th</sup>** robot. You are also given a 2D integer array `factory` where **factory[j] = [position<sub>j</sub>, limit<sub>j</sub>]** indicates that **position<sub>j</sub>** is the position of the **j<sup>th</sup>** factory and that the **j<sup>th</sup>** factory can repair at most **limit<sub>j</sub>** robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The positions of each robot are **unique**. The positions of each factory are also **unique**. Note that a robot can be **in the same position** as a factory initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At any moment**, you can set the initial direction of moving for **some** robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return *the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots*. The test cases are generated such that all the robots can be repaired.\n",

    "**Note that**\n",
    "- All robots move at the same speed.\n",
    "- If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.\n",
    "- If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.\n",
    "- If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.\n",
    "- If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`.\n",
