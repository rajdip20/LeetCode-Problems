    "There are `n` **1-indexed** robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given **0-indexed** integer arrays `positions`, `healths`, and a string `directions` (`directions[i]` is either **'L'** for **left** or **'R'** for **right**). All integers in `positions` are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "All robots start moving on the line **simultaneously** at the **same speed** in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will **collide**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two robots collide, the robot with **lower health** is **removed** from the line, and the health of the other robot **decreases by one**. The surviving robot continues in the **same** direction it was going. If both robots have the **same** health, they are both removed from the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine the **health** of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same **order** that the robots were given, i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.\n",

    ">**Output:** [2,17,9,15,10]<br>\n",
    ">**Explanation:** No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].\n",

    ">**Input:** positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = \"RLRL\"<br>\n",
    ">**Output:** [14]<br>\n",
    ">**Explanation:** There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].\n",

    ">**Explanation:** Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].\n",
