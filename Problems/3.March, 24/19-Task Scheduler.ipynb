    "You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, `n`. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: **identical** tasks must be separated by at least `n` intervals due to cooling time.\n",
