    "There are `n` students in a class numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number `0`, then the student number `1`, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number `n - 1`.

When the student number `i` is given a problem to solve, they will use `chalk[i]` pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is **strictly less** than `chalk[i]`, then the student number `i` will be asked to **replace** the chalk.\n",
