    "You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` people numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `meetings` where **meetings[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]** indicates that person **x<sub>i</sub>** and person **y<sub>i</sub>** have a meeting at **time<sub>i</sub>**. A person may attend **multiple meetings** at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer `firstPerson`.\n",
