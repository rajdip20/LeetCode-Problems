    "Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **canonical path** should have the following format:\n",
    "- The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.\n",
    "- Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.\n",
    "- The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.\n",
