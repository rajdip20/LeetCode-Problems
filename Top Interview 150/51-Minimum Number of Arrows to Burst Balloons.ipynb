    "There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where **points[i] = [x<sub>start</sub>, x<sub>end</sub>]** denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between **x<sub>start</sub>** and **x<sub>end</sub>**. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.\n",

    "Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with **x<sub>start</sub>** and **x<sub>end</sub>** is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if **x<sub>start</sub> <= x <= x<sub>end</sub>**. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.\n",
