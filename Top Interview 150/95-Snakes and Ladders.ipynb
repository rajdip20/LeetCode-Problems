    "You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `board` where the cells are labeled from **1** to **n<sup>2</sup>** in a [Boustrophedon style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon) starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. `board[n - 1][0]`) and alternating direction each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start on square `1` of the board. In each move, starting from square `curr`, do the following:\n",
    "- Choose a destination square `next` with a label in the range **[curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n<sup>2</sup>)]**.\n",
    "    - This choice simulates the result of a standard **6-sided die roll**: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.\n",
    "- If `next` has a snake or ladder, you **must** move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to `next`.\n",
    "- The game ends when you reach the square **n<sup>2</sup>**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares **1** and **n<sup>2</sup>** do not have a snake or ladder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do **not** follow the subsequent snake or ladder.\n",
    "- For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do **not** follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.\n",
